# Build a Healthcare Agent to Automate Patient Appointments

## Scenario

Northstar Community Hospital operates multiple outpatient clinics and
receives hundreds of appointment requests every day through phone calls
and emails. This manual scheduling process often results in long wait
times, booking conflicts, and increased administrative workload for
front-desk staff.

To improve patient experience and operational efficiency, the hospital
is implementing an AI-powered patient assistant built with Microsoft
Copilot Studio. The assistant enables patients to securely verify their
identity, ask hospital-related questions, view available appointment
slots, book appointments, and cancel existing bookings. Behind the
scenes, Power Automate orchestrates appointment retrieval and booking
while Microsoft Dataverse stores appointment information.

By the end of this lab, you will have built an intelligent healthcare
agent that combines conversational AI with business process automation
to streamline patient appointment management.

## Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create and populate Microsoft Dataverse tables for healthcare
  appointment management.

- Build a healthcare conversational agent using Microsoft Copilot
  Studio.

- Configure knowledge sources and implement responsible AI guardrails.

- Create reusable conversational topics for identity verification,
  appointment booking, cancellation, and emergency assistance.

- Build Power Automate agent flows that retrieve available appointment
  slots and confirm bookings.

- Connect Copilot Studio topics with Power Automate flows.

- Test an end-to-end AI-powered appointment booking experience.

## Lab Summary

In this lab, you built an AI-powered healthcare appointment assistant
using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Dataverse, and Power Automate.
You created a secure conversational experience that verifies patient
identity, answers hospital-related questions using organizational
knowledge, handles emergency scenarios responsibly, and enables patients
to book or cancel appointments.

You also automated the appointment management process by integrating
Power Automate flows with Copilot Studio, allowing the agent to retrieve
available appointment slots, update appointment records in Dataverse,
and return booking confirmations in real time. Finally, you validated
the complete end-to-end solution by testing patient interactions and
confirming successful appointment bookings.
