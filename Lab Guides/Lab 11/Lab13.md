# Lab 11: Build a Healthcare Agent to Automate Patient Appointments

### Estimated Duration: 100 Minutes

## Scenario

Northstar Community Hospital operates multiple outpatient clinics and receives hundreds of appointment requests every day through phone calls and emails. This manual scheduling process often results in long wait times, booking conflicts, and increased administrative workload for front-desk staff.

To improve patient experience and operational efficiency, the hospital is implementing an AI-powered patient assistant built with Microsoft Copilot Studio. The assistant enables patients to securely verify their identity, ask hospital-related questions, view available appointment slots, book appointments, and cancel existing bookings. Behind the scenes, Power Automate orchestrates appointment retrieval and booking while Microsoft Dataverse stores appointment information.

By the end of this lab, you will have built an intelligent healthcare agent that combines conversational AI with business process automation to streamline patient appointment management.

## Persona

**Emily Carter** **Role:** Digital Transformation Lead - Northstar Community Hospital

Emily is responsible for modernizing patient services by implementing AI-powered healthcare solutions. Her objective is to reduce administrative effort, improve appointment scheduling efficiency, and provide patients with a secure self-service experience while ensuring sensitive healthcare interactions follow responsible AI practices.

## Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Create and populate Microsoft Dataverse tables for healthcare
  appointment management.

- Build a healthcare conversational agent using Microsoft Copilot
  Studio.

- Configure knowledge sources and implement responsible AI guardrails.
- Create reusable conversational topics for identity verification,
  appointment booking, cancellation, and emergency assistance.

- Build Power Automate agent flows that retrieve available appointment
  slots and confirm bookings.

- Connect Copilot Studio topics with Power Automate flows.
- Test an end-to-end AI-powered appointment booking experience.


## Exercise 0 - Prepare the Healthcare Data Foundation

Create and populate the Dataverse table that will store appointment slot information used throughout the lab.

## Summary

In this lab, you built an AI-powered healthcare appointment assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Dataverse, and Power Automate. You created a secure conversational experience that verifies patient identity, answers hospital-related questions using organizational knowledge, handles emergency scenarios responsibly, and enables patients to book or cancel appointments.

You also automated the appointment management process by integrating Power Automate flows with Copilot Studio, allowing the agent to retrieve available appointment slots, update appointment records in Dataverse, and return booking confirmations in real time. Finally, you validated the complete end-to-end solution by testing patient interactions and confirming successful appointment bookings.
