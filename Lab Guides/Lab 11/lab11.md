# Lab 11 - Modernize Customer Support at Zava Retail with an AI-Powered Product Knowledge Agent using Azure AI Search and Foundry Models

**Estimated duration** – 60 minutes

## Scenario:

Zava Retail is a fast-growing omnichannel retailer specializing in home
appliances and consumer electronics, operating both physical stores and
a rapidly expanding e-commerce platform across multiple regions. As
product complexity increases—especially for items like washing machines,
refrigerators, and smart home devices—customers frequently reach out for
support related to product specifications, installation guidance,
warranty coverage, and troubleshooting.

Currently, Zava Retail’s customer support model relies heavily on:

- Static FAQ pages on the website

- High call volumes handled by centralized support teams

- Manual lookup of product manuals by agents

This approach is creating **operational bottlenecks**:

- Call center volumes are increasing, leading to long wait times

- Support agents spend significant time searching across scattered
  documents

- Customers receive inconsistent answers depending on the agent’s
  experience

- Digital self-service channels fail to handle nuanced or
  product-specific queries

To address these challenges, Zava Retail’s Digital Innovation team has
initiated a **Customer Support Modernization program** to introduce
AI-driven self-service capabilities.

As part of this initiative, the team plans to deploy an **AI-powered
Product Knowledge Agent** integrated into their website and support
channels. This agent will:

- Leverage **Azure AI Search** to index product manuals, warranty
  policies, and troubleshooting guides stored in internal repositories

- Use **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to fetch precise,
  context-aware information

- Provide **natural, conversational responses** to customer queries

- Include **direct references to source documents** for transparency and
  trust

- Integrate **custom or bring-your-own models from Microsoft Foundry**
  to tailor responses to Zava Retail’s tone, product catalog, and
  support policies

This solution is expected to:

- Reduce call center volume by enabling effective self-service

- Improve first-contact resolution rates

- Ensure consistent and accurate responses across channels

- Enhance overall customer satisfaction and brand trust

- Enable scalable, 24/7 support without proportional increases in
  staffing

In this lab, you will act as Elena Rodriguez, an AI Engineer at Zava
Retail, and simulate the company’s implementation by building and
configuring an intelligent product support agent using Azure AI
Search, Azure OpenAI, and Microsoft Copilot Studio, while also
integrating a custom model from Microsoft Foundry to align with
enterprise-grade AI deployment practices.

documents and required Role permissions to it.

## Exercise 3: Create an Azure OpenAI Service and deploy a model

The AI Search service will have to vectorize the data uploaded, in order
to perform the search over the documents. To vectorize the data, an
embedding model needs to be deployed. In this exercise, you will create
an Azure OpenAI Service and deploy the text-embedding model in it.

Now that the model is deployed, you can use it in Copilot Studio’s agent
prompt.

## Exercise 8: Create a prompt in the Copilot Studio and use the model created in Azure AI Foundry

In this exercise, you will learn how to bring the deployed model from
Azure AI Foundry in the Copilot Studio. Here, we are using a base model
that is deployed. We can also create a fine tuned model as per the
business requirements and then use it in Copilot Studio.

1.  From the Copilot Studio agent, select **Tools** from the top menu
    bar.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

6.  Enter the below details and click on Connect.

    - Model deployment name - +++ModelforMCS+++

    - Base model name - +++gpt-4o+++

    - Azure model endpoint URL – Enter the target url saved earlier

    - API Key – Enter the model API key saved earlier.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image82.png)

    ![A screen shot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image83.png)

7.  Once connected, select **Close**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image84.png)

8.  You can see that the model ModelforMCS is selected now

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image85.png)

9.  Rename the prompt to +++WM Types+++. Enter +++What are the different
    types of Washing Machines?+++ and select **Test**.

    ![](./media/image86.png)

10. Select **Save** to save the prompt.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image87.png)

11. Select the **Add and configure** option to add the prompt to the
    agent.

    incorrect.](./media/image88.png)

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image89.png)

With this feature, we can fine-tune the model in Microsoft Foundry and
use it in Copilot Studio with ease. We can bring in the vast ecosystem
of the models in the Azure AI Foundry easily into the Copilot Studio.

## Summary

In this lab, you created a knowledge-driven AI support agent by integrating Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, and Microsoft Copilot Studio. You started by uploading and indexing product documents, then enabled vector-based search using an embedding model to support accurate information retrieval.

You connected this knowledge base to a Copilot Studio agent, allowing it to answer customer queries with relevant, document-backed responses. Finally, you integrated a model from Azure AI Foundry and used it within a custom prompt to extend the agent’s capabilities.

This lab demonstrates how to build and connect the core components required for a RAG-based, enterprise-ready support solution.
