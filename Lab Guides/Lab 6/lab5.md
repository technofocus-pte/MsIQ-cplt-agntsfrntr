# Lab 6 - Improve communication and work coordination across Zava Retail stores with a Frontline Agent

**Estimated Duration:** 40 minutes

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will create a Frontline Operations Agent using Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Builder. The agent will help frontline workers, store managers, and supervisors handle daily operations, customer service, shift readiness, compliance, and escalation workflows. You will configure agent instructions, upload enterprise knowledge sources, test prompts, validate outputs, and optimize responses. After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Create a Microsoft 365 Copilot custom agent
- Configure frontline retail agent instructions
- Upload knowledge sources for grounding
- Test store operations prompts
- Improve frontline productivity with AI
- Build reusable retail frontline agent templates


## Scenario

Zava Retail is a rapidly expanding multi-format retail chain operating:
- 250 stores across urban, suburban, and tier-2 markets
- 8,000 employees including cashiers, floor associates, warehouse staff,
  supervisors, and managers

- Presence across multiple regions, each with different staffing
  patterns and customer behavior

- Heavy seasonal demand spikes during festivals, clearance sales, school
  openings, and holiday promotions

- Thousands of frontline operational requests every week


Zava Retail has invested in Microsoft 365 and wants to modernize store execution using a Microsoft 365 Copilot Frontline Agent.

### Key Challenges:
- Managers spend too much time answering repetitive questions
- Store processes are inconsistent across locations
- Seasonal sales create staffing and service pressure
- New hire onboarding takes too much manual effort
- Operational issues are escalated at a slow pace


To solve these challenges, Zava Retail deploys a **Microsoft 365 Copilot Frontline Agent** accessible in Copilot chat, Microsoft Teams, and mobile devices for store workers. The agent becomes a 24x7 AI operations Assistant for multiple retail stores. The Zava Frontline Agent will help 8,000 employees across 250 stores work more efficiently by giving instant, consistent answers and reducing dependence on managers.

## Summary

In this lab, learners explored how Zava Retail can improve store operations using a **Microsoft 365 Copilot Frontline Operations Agent**. With 250 stores, 8,000 employees, and high seasonal demand, Zava Retail needed a scalable solution to reduce manager workload, improve consistency, and support frontline staff in real time.

In this lab, you created a custom agent to help store associates, cashiers, supervisors, and managers with daily tasks such as opening and closing procedures, shift readiness, promotions, returns, stock issues, safety incidents, and escalations.

The agent was grounded using SOPs, policies, FAQs, checklists, and training documents, then tested through real retail scenarios and persona-based prompts.

By the end of the lab, learners demonstrated how the Zava Frontline Agent can:
        - Reduce repetitive questions to managers
        - Improve consistency across stores
        - Speed up onboarding for new hires
        - Enable faster issue resolution
        - Improve frontline productivity and customer service


This lab showed how AI-powered frontline agents can help Zava Retail scale operations while empowering employees with instant support.
