# Lab – Orchestrating multi-agent AI for retail using Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, and Fabric

## Objective:

Build an intelligent, multi-agent retail assistant using Microsoft
Copilot Studio, MicrosoftFoundry, and Microsoft Fabric. In this lab, you
will design and implement a customer-facing AI system that orchestrates
across specialized agents to handle product discovery, customer support,
policy queries, and real-time operational insights.

## Scenario: “Zava Outdoor Retail Assistant”

A premium outdoor retail brand (focused on **camping & trekking gear**)
wants to build an intelligent assistant that:

- Helps customers **discover products** (backpacks, tents, accessories)

- Answers **policy-related questions** (returns, shipping, refunds)

- Handles **support queries**

- Provides **guided recommendations for outdoor trips**

## Exercise 1: Create Copilot Studio agent

In this exercise, you will create the primary Copilot Studio agent that
acts as the central interface for customer interactions. This agent will
be responsible for handling support queries and grounding responses
using enterprise knowledge sources.

### Task 1: Create the agent and configure knowledge sources

In this task, you will create the +++TrailAssist Concierge+++ agent,
configure its behavior, and ground it with knowledge sources related to
shipping, returns, and customer support policies.

1.  Login to +++https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/+++ with your
    login credentials

    - Username - <+++@lab.CloudPortalCredential>(User1).Username+++

    - TAP - <+++@lab.CloudPortalCredential>(User1).AccessToken+++

2.  Select **Get Started** to activate the Copilot Studio trial.

3.  Select **Agents** -> **+ Create blank agent**. Enter the name
    +++TrailAssist Concierge+++

    ![](./media/image2.png)

4.  Select **Edit** to edit the details of the agent and enter the below
    description and select **Save**.

    ```
    A customer-facing AI assistant that helps users with
    order support, returns, refunds, and shipping queries while coordinating
    with a product specialist agent for recommendations and product-specific
    details.
    ```
    ![](./media/image3.png)

    ![](./media/image4.png)

5.  Select **Edit** against Instructions to add instructions to the
    agent.

    ![](./media/image5.png)

6. Enter the below instructions and select **Save**.
    ```
    You are TrailAssist Concierge, a helpful and professional retail assistant for an outdoor gear company.

    Your responsibilities:
    - Answer questions related to returns, refunds, shipping, and customer support.
    - Use the provided knowledge base to give accurate answers.
    - If a question is about products (such as backpacks, tents, camping gear, recommendations, or comparisons), delegate the query to the connected product specialist agent.
    - Always provide clear, structured, and polite responses.

    Guidelines:
    - Be concise but informative.
    - If unsure, ask clarifying questions.
    - Do not hallucinate product details-rely on the product agent.
    ```
    ![](./media/image6.png)

7. Select **Settings** to update the agent’s settings.

    ![](./media/image7.png)

8. Under **Knowledge**, **disable** **Allow ungrounded
    responses** and **Use information from the web** options and then
    select **Save**.

    ![](./media/image8.png)

9. Once the changes are saved, close the Settings pane.

    ![](./media/image9.png)

10. Back in the Overview page of the agent, select **+ Add knowledge**.

    ![](./media/image10.png)

11. **Browse** for the files, select the files under **C:\Labfiles\MCS
    Agent** and click **Open**.

    ![](./media/image11.png)

    ![](./media/image12.png)

12. In the next screen, select **Add to agent**.

    ![](./media/image13.png)

    ![](./media/image14.png)

13. Ensure that the added documents change to **Ready** state.

    \[!Alert\] It may take up to 10 mminutes for the status to change to
    "Ready".

    ![](./media/image15.png)

    You have successfully created and configured the Copilot Studio agent
    and grounded it with relevant knowledge sources to handle customer
    support and policy-related queries.

## Task 2: Test the agent

In this task, you will test the agent to validate that it correctly
retrieves and responds using the configured knowledge sources.

1.  Select the Test pane from the top right and enter:

    How long does delivery take to metro cities?

    ![](./media/image16.png)

2.  You can see that the agent replies from the added knowledge source.

    ![](./media/image17.png)

3.  Try another prompt as below and observe the response

    Can I return a product after 7 days?

    ![](./media/image18.png)

    ![](./media/image19.png)

    You have verified that the agent can accurately respond to user queries
    using its knowledge base, ensuring reliable and grounded interactions.

    You have successfully built the foundational Copilot Studio agent that
    serves as the orchestrator for customer interactions.

## Exercise 2: Foundry agent

In this exercise, you will enhance the solution by creating a
specialized product expert agent using Microsoft Foundry and integrating
it with the Copilot Studio agent.

### Task 1: Create Foundry resource

    - If data is not available, say so clearly.

    - Do not answer product recommendation or policy-related questions.

    - Focus on insights, trends, and real-time operational data.
    ```

    ![](./media/image71.png)

21. Test the agent with the below question: Which products are low in
    stock? and observe that the agent replies based on the data in the
    lakehouse.

    ![](./media/image72.png)

    ![](./media/image73.png)

22. Select **Publish** to publish the agent.

    ![](./media/image74.png)

    ![](./media/image75.png)

You have successfully created and configured the Fabric Data Agent to
provide insights based on business data.

### Task 3: Add Fabric Data Agent to the Copilot Studio agent

In this task, you will integrate the Fabric Data Agent with the Copilot
Studio agent to enable real-time data-driven responses.

1.  In the Copilot studio, Select **Agents** tab from the **TrailAssist
    Concierge** agent in Copilot Studio.

    ![](./media/image76.png)

2.  Select **+ Add an agent**, **Connect to an external
    agent** -\> **Microsoft Fabric**.

inventory, customer activity, and operational metrics using structured
data from Fabric Lakehouse.

    ![](./media/image82.png)

    ![](./media/image83.png)

You have successfully integrated the Fabric Data Agent, enabling the
Copilot Studio agent to access real-time operational insights.

## Task 4: Test the agent

In this task, you will test the end-to-end solution to validate that the
Copilot Studio agent orchestrates across all connected agents.

1.  Select the **Test** pane.

    ![](./media/image84.png)

2.  Enter +++Show the recent orders+++ and
    click **Send**. **Allow** connection for the first time to proceed.

    ![](./media/image85.png)

    ![](./media/image86.png)

3.  Navigate to the **Activity** tab to view the result. You can also
    see that the agent has internally called the **Fabric Data
    Agent** to answer the question.

    ![](./media/image87.png)

4.  Send +++Which products are low in stock?+++ questions in the Test
    pane and see the output coming from the Fabric Data agent.

    ![](./media/image88.png)

    ![](./media/image89.png)

The Copilot Studio base agent now orchestrates the request to the
Foundry or Fabric agents or answers itself based on the type of the
question and the purpose of the agent.

You have validated that the Copilot Studio agent can intelligently route
queries and orchestrate responses across multiple specialized agents.

You have successfully completed the multi-agent architecture by adding a
data-driven agent, enabling real-time insights and advanced
orchestration.

## Summary:

In this lab, you created the **Retail Assistant**, a modern AI solution
for an outdoor retail company. You began by building a Copilot Studio
agent that serves as the primary customer interface for handling support
and policy-related queries. You then extended its capabilities by
integrating a specialized product expert agent built using Microsoft
Foundry to provide intelligent product recommendations. Finally, you
added a Fabric Data Agent to enable real-time insights from structured
business data such as orders and inventory.

Now, you will have implemented a fully functional multi-agent system
that demonstrates orchestration, specialization, and data-driven
intelligence.
