# Lab 1 - Transform Zava Retail store operations with a Smart Email Triage & Productivity Agent

**Estimated duration:** 40 minutes

## Lab objectives

This lab introduces the Workflows Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot as an
AI-powered orchestration engine that goes beyond traditional automation.
Instead of building static workflows, you will design intelligent,
adaptive workflows (agents) that can plan, execute, and improve tasks
using natural language. In this lab, you will build an Intelligent Email
Triage Agent for Zava Retail that:

- Runs every weekday morning

- Reviews unread emails (last 24 hours)

- Identifies urgent/actionable emails

- Categorizes emails intelligently

- Generates summaries + next steps

- Sends structured output to Microsoft Teams

- Uses Work IQ to provide productivity insights

## Scenario

Zava Retail, a rapidly growing omnichannel retailer, faced increasing
operational complexity due to high volumes of communication across
customers, suppliers, and internal teams. With expansion across
e-commerce platform, 50+ physical stores, vendor and supplier ecosystem,
customer support and marketing teams, email became the primary but
inefficient channel for critical business interactions. Zava Retail
teams receive hundreds of emails daily from:

- Customers (complaints, returns, inquiries)

- Suppliers (inventory updates, delays)

- Internal teams (approvals, escalations)

This results in:

- Missed urgent emails

- Slow response times

- Employee burnout due to overload

- Lack of visibility into priorities

To address this challenge, Zava Retail is looking to implement an
AI-powered Intelligent Workflow Agent using Microsoft 365 Copilot to
automate email triage, highlight urgent and actionable items, deliver
insights to workload and productivity, and provide real-time
productivity insights.

**Key Personas**

1.  **Marie Brown – Customer Support Manager**

The customer support manager at Zava Retail manages the customer support
inbox, handles escalations and SLA (Service-level agreement) compliance,
and coordinates with logistics and SLA compliance.

2.  **David Turner – Supply Chain Coordinator**

The supply chain coordinator at Zava Retail tracks vendor
communications, manages inventory updates and delays, and coordinates

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how the Workflows Agent in Microsoft 365
Copilot enables a shift from static automation to AI-powered, adaptive
workflows. Instead of predefined rules, you built an intelligent agent
that understands context, makes decisions, and improves over time.

You created an Email Triage Agent for Zava Retail that runs every
weekday, reviews recent unread emails, identifies urgent items,
categorizes messages, generates summaries with next steps, and shares
structured outputs in Microsoft Teams. It also uses Work IQ to provide
productivity insights.

As a result, Zava Retail reduced email overload, improved response
times, automated task handling, and minimized missed escalations while
demonstrating how AI-driven agents can enhance operational efficiency
and decision-making.
