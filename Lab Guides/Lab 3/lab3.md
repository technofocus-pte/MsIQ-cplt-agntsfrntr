# Lab 3-Build the Zava Retail workforce upskilling Learning Agent with Microsoft 365 Copilot

**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes

## Lab objectives 

In this lab, you will explore how to build a Workforce Upskilling Agent
using Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Builder. You will learn how to
configure the agent aligned to workforce transformation goals, ground it
in organizational context using Work IQ principles, and enrich it with
enterprise knowledge sources. By the end of this lab, you will be able
to:

- Build a custom Workforce Upskilling Agent using Microsoft 365 Copilot
  Agent Builder

- Configure agent instructions aligned to retail workforce
  transformation goals

- Ground the agent in organizational context using Work IQ principles

- Add enterprise knowledge sources to improve agent relevance

- Diagnose employee skill gaps using operational behavior signals

- Generate personalized learning plans for multiple workforce personas

- Use the agent to simulate coaching conversations and leadership
  role-play

- Produce workforce readiness briefings for executive stakeholders

## Scenario

You are Jordan Mercer, Chief Operating Officer of Zava Retail — a
mid-sized retail chain specializing in consumer electronics and home
goods, operating across four regional store clusters in the Midwest.
Zava Retail is eighteen months into a digital transformation initiative:

- A new Retail Management System (RMS) is being rolled out company-wide

- AI-powered inventory forecasting is active in two regional store
  clusters

- Customer behavior analytics tools are being adopted by store
  supervisors

- ERP migration completes next quarter

Technology adoption is accelerating faster than employee readiness. To
address this challenge, you will build and deploy a Workforce Upskilling
Agent that helps identify skill gaps, personalize employee learning
journeys, and improve workforce readiness across operations.

**Key Personas**

1.  Jordan Mercer (COO – Primary Persona): Leads digital transformation
    strategy and oversees workforce capability planning.

2.  Alex Chen (Store Operations Supervisor)- Frequently overrides AI
    inventory alerts without reviewing them.

3.  Maria Santos (Supply Chain Analyst)- Leaving in 60 days with
    undocumented critical supplier knowledge.

4.  Derek Okonkwo (Operations Coordinator)- Low RMS adoption despite
    extensive legacy systems experience.

## Summary

In this lab, you built a custom Workforce Upskilling Agent in Microsoft
365 Copilot designed to support retail workforce transformation. You
configured the agent’s behavior to align with workforce development
goals, grounded it in organizational context for more relevant and
accurate responses, and used operational signals to diagnose workforce
skill gaps. The lab also guided you through generating personalized
learning plans tailored to employee needs, refining agent responses
through prompt engineering for improved effectiveness, and producing
workforce readiness briefings to support decision-making and training
strategy.
