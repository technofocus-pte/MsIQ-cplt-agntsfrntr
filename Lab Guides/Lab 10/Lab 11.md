# Lab 10: Build and Deploy a Project Management Assistant with the Microsoft Teams SDK

**Duration:** 50 minutes

## Lab scenario

**Zava Retail** is a retail company with stores and digital commerce operations, supported by technology teams that manage multiple business and customer-facing projects. **Maya Kapoor, a Project Manager at Zava Retail,** manages several projects and needs to stay informed about project progress, risks, priorities, upcoming meetings, and stakeholder updates.

To help project teams work more efficiently, **Christine Parker, CTO** at Zava Retail, has asked the technology team to introduce a project-management assistant directly in Microsoft Teams**,** where teams already collaborate, hold meetings, and share project updates. Using the **Microsoft Teams SDK**, you will build a **Zava Project Status Assistant** that can support multiple projects and help users quickly access project information and take action from within Teams. For this lab, **Project Phoenix** is used as an example project with an **At Risk** status, a customer review scheduled for **tomorrow**, **three open issues**, and **two remaining deployment tasks**. You will build the assistant using Python, run it locally, expose it through a **Microsoft Dev Tunnel**, register it using the **Teams Developer CLI**, and interact with it directly in Microsoft Teams.

## Key persona

### Maya Kapoor — Project Manager, Zava Retail

Manages multiple projects and uses the **Zava Project Status Assistant** to quickly check project status, priorities, meeting preparation, and project updates.

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create a **Python Teams SDK** application.
- Build a **project-focused assistant** that can work with multiple Zava Retail projects.
- Run the assistant locally and expose it through a **Microsoft Dev Tunnel**.
- Register and deploy the application to **Microsoft Teams** using the Teams Developer CLI.
- Retrieve project status, priorities, and meeting preparation information directly in Teams.
- Generate and interact with a **project update using an Adaptive Card**.


## Exercise 1 - Create the Teams SDK project

In this exercise, you create the foundation for the **Zava Project Status Assistant** using the **Microsoft Teams SDK for Python**. You also create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies required to run the application.

### What is the Teams SDK?

Teams SDK is a suite of packages for building agents and applications on Microsoft Teams. It handles authentication, event routing, and Teams-specific plumbing so you can focus on your app's logic. Using this, you can create  AI-powered agents, message extensions, embedded web apps, Adaptive Cards, dialogs, Microsoft Graph integrations, and more across TypeScript, C#, and Python.

### Task 1 - Create a project

1. Open Command Prompt and login into teams using the following command:

    `teams login`

    If the above command gives an error then you can use the following command:

    `teams login --device-code`

1. Run the following command to log in to Azure.

    `az login`

1. Check the status of the Teams login. Make sure it shows Sideloading: enabled.

    `teams status`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image7.png)

1. After successfully logging in, create a new project using the following command:

    `teams project new python project-assistant --template echo`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/a1.png)

1. Enter +++Y+++ and hit Enter. This confirms you want to scaffold a new Python-based Teams app named project-assistant using the echo template.

## Exercise 2 — Build the Project Assistant

In this exercise, you will transform the starter Teams SDK echo application into a business-focused project assistant for Project Phoenix. You will add project data and message-handling logic to provide status updates, priorities, and meeting preparation.

### Task 1: Create the Project Assistant agent in Teams SDK

1. Open Visual Studio Code and open the **project-assistant** folder from C:\demouser
  
    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image13.png)

## Exercise 3 — Understand the Project Assistant Code(Read Only)

Now that you have created the Project Assistant, let's review its structure and key components. Understanding how these components work together will help you extend the assistant with additional capabilities.

1. **Project Structure**

    The Project Assistant uses a simple project structure:

    project-assistant/

    ├── src

    └── main.py \# Main application code

    src/: Contains the application source code.

    main.py: The entry point of the application. It defines the project information, response functions, message handling, and application startup.

1. **The App Class**

    The heart of an application is the App class. This class handles all incoming activities and manages the application's lifecycle. It also acts as a way to host your application service.

    ```
    from microsoft_teams.apps import App, ActivityContext
    from microsoft_teams.api import MessageActivity

    app = App()

    ```

    The app configuration includes a variety of options that allow you to customize its behavior, including controlling the underlying server, authentication, and other settings.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image15.png)

1. **Project Information**

    The assistant needs information about Project Phoenix to provide useful responses. This information is stored in a Python dictionary.
    ```
    PROJECT = {
        "name": "Project Phoenix",
        "owner": "Priya Nair",
        "status": "At Risk",
        "customer_review": "Tomorrow",
        "open_issues": 3,
        "deployment_tasks": 2,
        "next_milestone": "Production deployment",
    }

    ```

    Each key represents a piece of project information that can be used by the assistant when generating responses. This approach also makes it easy to update the project details without changing the message-handling logic.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image16.png)

1. **Response Functions**

    The assistant uses separate Python functions to generate responses for different types of requests.

    For example:
    ```
    def project_status():
        return f"""
        **Project Phoenix — Current Status**

        **Overall status:** {PROJECT["status"]}
        **Project owner:** {PROJECT["owner"]}
        **Customer review:** {PROJECT["customer_review"]}
        """

    ```

    The application also includes functions for meeting preparation and daily priorities:
    - project_status() — Provides the current project status.
    - meeting_preparation() — Provides information to help prepare for a
    project meeting.

    - priorities() — Provides the recommended project priorities.

    Separating these functions keeps the response logic organized and makes the application easier to extend.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image16.png)


1. **Message Handling**

    Teams applications can respond to different types of activities. In this application, the assistant responds to incoming messages using the @app.on_message handler.

    ```
    @app.on_message
    async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
        text = (ctx.activity.text or "").lower().strip()
    ```

    The handler receives the incoming message through the ActivityContext and reads the text sent by the user. The application then checks the message to determine what information the user is requesting. For example:

    ```
    if "status" in text:
        await ctx.send(project_status())
        return
    ```

    When a user asks about the project status, the application calls project_status() and sends the result back to the user.

    The same approach is used to handle meeting preparation and priority-related questions.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image17.png)

1. **Sending Responses**

    The ctx.send() method sends a message from the assistant back to the user in Teams.

    `await ctx.send(project_status())`

    In this example, the project_status() function generates the response and ctx.send() delivers it to the Teams conversation.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/a4.png)

1. **Fallback Response**

    Not every user message will match the conditions defined in the application. When no matching keyword is found, the assistant provides examples of questions that it can handle.
    ```
    await ctx.send(
        "I can help with Project Phoenix.\n\n"
        "Try:\n"
        "• What is the current status of Project Phoenix?\n"
        "• Prepare me for my Phoenix project meeting.\n"
        "• What should I focus on today?"
    )

    ```

    This gives the user guidance instead of leaving the message unanswered.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image18.png)

1. **Application Lifecycle**

    The application starts when main.py is executed.

    ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import asyncio
        asyncio.run(app.start())

    ```

    This code initializes your application server and, when configured for Teams, also authenticates it to be ready for sending and receiving messages.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image19.png)


## Exercise 4 — Run the agent locally

In this exercise, you start the Python application and verify its message-handling logic before connecting it to Microsoft Teams. Testing locally first helps you catch code or dependency issues before you introduce the Dev Tunnel and Teams registration steps.

1. Navigate back to the command prompt and start the development server using the following command.

    `python .\src\main.py`

    >[!Note] Keep this window running; do not close this window.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image20.png)

1. In the console, you should see a similar output:

    The HTTP server is now listening on port 3978.

1. Now open a new command prompt. Test your agent locally without sideloading it into Teams, using the Microsoft 365 Agents Playground. So run the following command in the command prompt to open the M365 Agent Playground:

    `agentsplayground -e http://localhost:3978/api/messages -c emulator`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image21.png)

1. Enter the following prompts:

    `Prompt 1: +++Hello`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image22.png)

    ![A screenshot of a chat AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image23.png)

    Prompt 2: +++ What is the current status of Project Phoenix?+++

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image24.png)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image25.png)

1. Close the window to end the M365 playground, and press CTRL + C in both windows to end the current process.


## Exercise 5 - Add the Adaptive Card

In this exercise, you extend the project assistant with an interactive Adaptive Card. The card presents a project update in a structured format and lets the user choose whether to send or cancel the update. This introduces a practical Teams interaction beyond plain text messages.

### Task 1 - Adding the Adaptive Card to the agent

1. Open VS code again and open main.py file.

1. Replace the existing import section at the very top of main.py with this:

    ```
    from microsoft_teams.apps import App, ActivityContext
    from microsoft_teams.api import (
        MessageActivity,
        AdaptiveCardInvokeActivity,
        AdaptiveCardActionMessageResponse,
        InvokeResponse,
    )
    from microsoft_teams.cards import AdaptiveCard, TextBlock, ExecuteAction
    
    ```

    This adds the Teams SDK classes required to create an Adaptive Card and handle button actions.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image26.png)

1. Add this entire block after the priorities() function and before @app.on_message:

    ```
    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Adaptive Card
    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    def project_update_card():
    
        return AdaptiveCard(
            version="1.5",
    
            body=[
                TextBlock(
                    text="Project Phoenix — Team Update",
                    weight="Bolder",
                    size="Large",
                    wrap=True,
                ),
    
                TextBlock(
                    text="Status: AT RISK",
                    weight="Bolder",
                    wrap=True,
                ),
    
                TextBlock(
                    text=(
                        "Customer review: Tomorrow\n"
                        "Open issues: 3\n"
                        "Deployment tasks remaining: 2\n"
                        "Next milestone: Production deployment"
                    ),
                    wrap=True,
                ),
    
                TextBlock(
                    text=(
                        "Priority: Complete the remaining deployment "
                        "tasks before the customer review."
                    ),
                    wrap=True,
                ),
            ],
    
            actions=[
                ExecuteAction(
                    title="Send Update",
                    verb="send_update",
                    data={
                        "action": "send_update"
                    },
                ),
    
                ExecuteAction(
                    title="Cancel",
                    verb="cancel_update",
                    data={
                        "action": "cancel_update"
                    },
                ),
            ],
        )

    ```

    This creates an Adaptive Card containing the current Phoenix project status and two interactive buttons: **Send Update** and **Cancel**.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image27.png)

1. Inside handle_message(), add this after the existing Priorities condition and before the Default response.

    ```
    # Adaptive Card
        if (
            "project update" in text
            or "draft an update" in text
            or "draft a project update" in text
        ):
            await ctx.send(project_update_card())
            return

    ```

    This connects a learner's message such as **"Draft a project update"** to the Adaptive Card

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image28.png)

1. Add the following adaptive card action handler before the main() function.

    ```
    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Adaptive Card action handler
    # ---------------------------------------------------------

### Task 2 — Change the application from local Playground mode to Teams mode

1. Open main.py file and look for the following line: app = App(skip_auth=True).

1. Remove skip_auth=True because it is only used for unauthenticated local Playground testing not for real Teams deployment. Your App() class should look like this:

    `app = App()`

    This matters because the Dev Tunnel is public. It is recommended to remove this because a public tunnel exposes the local port and authentication should remain enabled for real channel testing.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image30.png)


## Exercise 6 - Deploy the agent to the Teams

In this exercise, you make the assistant reachable from Microsoft Teams. You will expose the local application through a Microsoft Dev Tunnel, register the bot infrastructure with the Teams Developer CLI, and install the app in Teams for end-to-end testing.

### Task 1 — Create the Microsoft Dev Tunnel

1. Open a new command prompt and navigate to the current project folder.

    `cd C:\Users\demouser\project-assistant`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image31.png)

1. Log in to the dev tunnel using the following command:

    `devtunnel user login`

1. Select the current username and click **Continue**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image33.png)

1. Start the dev tunnel using the following command:

    `devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous`

    >[!Note] Do not close this window; keep it running.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image35.png)

1. Save the dev tunnel link in Notepad; we will use it in the next task.

### Task 2 — Restart the Python agent

1. Navigate back to the deployment server command prompt window and run the following command again:

    `python .\src\main.py`

    Keep this window running.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image37.png)


### Task 3 — Register and Install the Teams application

1. Open a new command prompt and navigate to the project folder:

    `cd C:\Users\demouser\project-assistant`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image38.png)

1. Make sure your Python environment is activated:

    `.venv\Scripts\activate`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image39.png)

1. To register the app. Replace the tunnel URL with **your actual URL**:

    `teams app create --name Project-Assistant --endpoint https://YOUR-TUNNEL-HOST/api/messages --env .env`

    For example:

    teams app create --name Project-Assistant --endpoint https://c29q1k0t-3978XX.use2.devtunnels.ms/api/messages --env .env

    Microsoft’s current registration quickstart uses `teams app create` with the public tunnel endpoint and `.env` for Python projects. The command creates/registers the bot infrastructure and prints the Teams App ID plus an **Install in Teams** link.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image40.png)

1. Enter +++y+++ to confirm the new application.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image41.png)

1. Select **Install in Teams** to install the app in Microsoft Teams.

    >[!Note] If you lost the Install in Teams link use the following command:

    `teams app get <YOUR-TEAMS-APP-ID> --install-link`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image42.png)

1. Select **Use the Web app instead**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer application AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image43.png)

1. Click **Add**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image44.png)

1. Select Open.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image45.png)


### Task 6 — Verify the generated .env file

1. Navigate to VS Code and open .env to see credentials generated by the Teams Developer CLI.

    The Python application will use these credentials when authentication is enabled.


## Exercise 7 — Validate the assistant end to end

Now that the app is installed in Teams, validate the complete flow from a Teams message to the Python application and back to the Teams client. Use the prompts below in order. After each prompt, confirm that the response matches the expected behavior.

1. To check project status, enter the following prompt:

    `What is the current status of Project Phoenix?`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image46.png)

    ![A screenshot of a chat AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image47.png)

1. To prepare for the project meeting, enter the following prompt:

    `Prepare me for my Phoenix project meeting.`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image48.png)

1. To generate the project update card, enter the following prompt:

    `Draft a project update.`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%2010/media/image49.png)

1. Click the **Send Update** button to test the card actions. The assistant returns a confirmation that the project update was sent successfully.

## Summary

In this lab, you built and deployed a **Zava Project Status Assistant** using the **Microsoft Teams SDK for Python**. You created a Teams application that provides Project Phoenix status, priorities, and meeting-preparation information, then enhanced it with an **Adaptive Card** that enables users to take action on a project update. You tested the application locally, exposed it through a **Microsoft Dev Tunnel**, and registered and installed it in **Microsoft Teams** using the Teams Developer CLI. Finally, you completed an end-to-end test in Teams to verify that the assistant can respond to project-related requests and process Adaptive Card actions.
