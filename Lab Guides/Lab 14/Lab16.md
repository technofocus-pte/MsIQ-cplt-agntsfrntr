# Lab 14 - Orchestrating multi-agent AI for retail using Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, and Fabric

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

##Overview:

Build an intelligent, multi-agent retail assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, and Microsoft Fabric. In this lab, you will design and implement a customer-facing AI system that orchestrates across specialized agents to handle product discovery, customer support, policy queries, and real-time operational insights.

## Scenario: “Zava Outdoor Retail Assistant”

A premium outdoor retail brand (focused on **camping & trekking gear**) wants to build an intelligent assistant that:
- Helps customers **discover products** (backpacks, tents accessories)
- Answers **policy-related questions** (returns, shipping, refunds)
- Handles **support queries**
- Provides **guided recommendations for outdoor trips**


## Exercise 1: Create Copilot Studio agent**

In this exercise, you will create the primary Copilot Studio agent that acts as the central interface for customer interactions. This agent will be responsible for handling support queries and grounding responses using enterprise knowledge sources.

### Task 1: Create the agent and configure knowledge sources

In this task, you will create the **TrailAssist Concierge** agent, configure its behavior, and ground it with knowledge sources related to shipping, returns, and customer support policies.

1. Open the browser and enter the following URL to navigate to Copilot Studio. +++https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/+++

1. Sign in using the following credentials:

    - Username - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++

1. Enter the below instructions and select **Save**.

    ```
    You are TrailAssist Concierge, the primary AI assistant for an outdoor
    retail company.

    Your responsibilities:

    - Answer customer questions related to returns, refunds, shipping,
    delivery, warranties, exchanges, and general customer support using
    the provided knowledge sources.

    - Coordinate with connected specialist agents whenever a request falls
    outside your domain.

    - Provide clear, concise, and professional responses.

    Delegation Rules:

    - For any product-related question (including backpacks, tents,
    camping gear, hiking equipment, product specifications, comparisons,
    recommendations, or trip planning), delegate the request to the
    connected TrailGearExpert agent.

    - For any operational or business data question (including inventory,
    orders, customers, shipments, or sales), delegate the request to the
    connected TrailOpsAnalyst agent.

    - Invoke the appropriate specialist agent only once for each user
    request.

    - Do not invoke the same specialist agent multiple times for the same
    question unless the user asks a new or different question.

    - After receiving a response from a specialist agent, immediately
    return that response to the user.

    - Do not perform additional reasoning, knowledge searches, or delegate
    the same request again after a specialist agent has responded.

    - Do not rewrite, summarize, expand, or modify the specialist agent's
    response.

    - Do not combine multiple responses from the same specialist agent.

    - If the specialist agent cannot answer the request, inform the user
    that the requested information is unavailable instead of invoking the
    agent again.

    Knowledge Usage:

    - Use your own knowledge sources only for returns, refunds, shipping,
    warranties, and customer support.

    - Never answer product or operational data questions yourself.

    - Never use your own knowledge sources for product recommendations or
    business data.

    Conversation Guidelines:

    - Be friendly, professional, and concise.

    - Ask clarifying questions only if the user's request is ambiguous
    before delegating.

    - Never hallucinate information.

    - Use only verified information from your knowledge sources or the
    connected specialist agents.

    ```

    The Copilot Studio base agent now orchestrates the request to the Foundry or Fabric agents or answers itself based on the type of the question and the purpose of the agent.

    You have validated that the Copilot Studio agent can intelligently route queries and orchestrate responses across multiple specialized agents.

    You have successfully completed the multi-agent architecture by adding a data-driven agent, enabling real-time insights and advanced orchestration.


## Summary:

In this lab, you created the **Retail Assistant**, a modern AI solution for an outdoor retail company. You began by building a Copilot Studio agent that serves as the primary customer interface for handling support and policy-related queries. You then extended its capabilities by integrating a specialized product expert agent built using Microsoft Foundry to provide intelligent product recommendations. Finally, you added a Fabric Data Agent to enable real-time insights from structured business data such as orders and inventory.

Now, you will have implemented a fully functional multi-agent system that demonstrates orchestration, specialization, and data-driven intelligence.
