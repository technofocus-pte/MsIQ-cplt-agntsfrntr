# Lab 5 - Build an Enterprise Marketing Operations Agent with Microsoft Copilot

Estimated duration: 40 minutes

## Scenario

Zava Retail is a growing SMB omnichannel retailer with 12 physical stores and a successful online business. Its marketing team runs frequent, multi-channel campaigns — seasonal sales, product launches, loyalty promotions — but has no consistent, repeatable way to plan them.

Every campaign brief looks different depending on who wrote it. Creative assets for email, social, SMS, and in-store signage are produced separately by different people, often inconsistent in tone and messaging. Executives receive campaign summaries in varying formats, which slows down approvals. And when a campaign needs to be adapted — for loyalty members, for a premium audience, or for different store regions — the team frequently starts over instead of building on the original plan.

As Marketing Operations Lead, Priya Nair is responsible for how campaigns move from idea to execution to executive sign-off. With a Summer Clearance campaign due for leadership approval by the end of the week, Priya needs a faster, more consistent way to plan the campaign, produce channel-ready assets, adapt it for different audiences and regions, and package it for executive review.

To solve this, Zava Retail has adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. Priya will build a reusable custom agent — the Zava Retail Marketing Operations Advisor — that plans campaigns to a consistent enterprise structure, generates creative assets, adapts content for different audiences and channels, and prepares executive-ready summaries.

### Objectives

During this lab, you will use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to:
- Create a custom Copilot agent — build a dedicated marketing operations
  assistant from scratch with a defined name and purpose.

- Configure enterprise-grade instructions — enforce a consistent,
  complete campaign structure and enable image generation and web search.

- Generate a structured campaign brief and creative assets — produce a
  complete campaign plan and a promotional banner from a single prompt.

- Adapt campaigns for different audiences, channels, and regions —
  refine content while preserving the original objective and KPIs.

- Prepare and validate an executive approval package — produce
  leadership-ready materials and confirm the agent works reliably for the whole team.


# Key Personas

- **Priya Nair – Marketing Operations Lead (Learner):** Owns campaign
  planning and execution at Zava Retail and builds the Copilot agent to standardize campaign briefs, creative assets, and executive reporting.

- **David Kim – VP of Marketing:** Executive sponsor for the Summer
  Clearance campaign who requires every campaign brief to include an executive summary, KPIs, and clearly flagged risks and assumptions before he will approve it.

- **Sam Osei – Creative Director:** Leads the creative team and needs
  channel-ready first-draft copy and imagery across email, social, SMS, and in-store signage so designers and copywriters aren't starting from a blank page.

- **Regional Store Directors – North, South, Urban, Rural:** Require the
  same campaign to be adapted to local context — timing, product emphasis, and preferred channels — without changing the underlying campaign objective.

## Exercise 2: Build the Summer Clearance Campaign Brief

David Kim has asked Priya for a complete campaign plan for the Summer Clearance event before he'll consider it for approval. In this exercise, you will test whether a single prompt produces a complete, structured campaign brief.

### Task 1 – Generate the Campaign Brief

1. Open a chat with the Zava Retail Marketing Operations Advisor.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image11.png)

1. Enter the following prompt, then select **Send**:

    ```
    Create a complete Summer Clearance campaign (up to 50% off apparel)
    with the full 9-section structure, and generate (render, don't just
    describe) a hero banner image for the Creative Assets section that
    reflects the offer and Zava Retail's brand voice.
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image12.png)

1. Confirm the Creative Assets section includes a promotional banner concept, and that an image has been generated if Image Generation is enabled.

    >[!Note] Generated outputs are non-deterministic and may vary across users, sessions, and environments.

1. Review the response and confirm it includes all nine required sections: Campaign Objective, Target Audience, Key Messaging, Channels, Timeline, KPIs, Risks and Assumptions, Executive Summary, and Creative Assets.

## Exercise 3: Generate Multi-channel Campaign Assets

Sam Osei's creative team needs a running start across every channel, not just the core brief. In this exercise, you will ask the agent to translate the Summer Clearance campaign into channel-ready assets for seven distinct formats in a single request.

### Task 1 – Generate Channel Assets

1. In the same conversation as Exercise 2 (to preserve campaign context), enter the following prompt, then select Send:

    ```
    Generate assets for this campaign across the following channels: Email,
    Teams announcement, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, SMS, and in-store
    digital signage. For each channel, provide the copy, tone adjustments,
    and any format-specific notes (e.g., character limits, image aspect
    ratio).
    
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image23.png)

1. Review each of the seven channel outputs and confirm they are adapted to the channel.

    incorrect.](./media/image28.png)


### Task 2 – Generate a Promotional Image

1. Enter the following prompt, then select Send:

    `Generate a promotional image for the Instagram post that matches the Summer Clearance campaign's messaging and Zava Retail's brand voice.`

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image29.png)

1. Confirm that an image is generated and visually consistent with the campaign messaging.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image30.png)


## Exercise 4: Refine the Campaign for Loyalty Members

David Kim has a follow-up request: loyalty program members shouldn't receive the same “everything must go” clearance messaging as everyone else — they should feel like they're getting early, exclusive access. In this exercise, you will refine the existing campaign without starting over.

### Task 1 – Refine for Audience and Brand Tone

1. In the same conversation, enter the following prompt, then select Send:

    `Refine this campaign for loyalty program members, with a more premium brand feel. Preserve the original campaign objective and KPIs, but adjust messaging, tone, and offer framing accordingly.`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image31.png)

1. Review the response and confirm it explicitly states:

    - What changed (e.g., messaging shifted from “clearance” to “exclusive
    loyalty access”)

    - What was preserved (objective, KPIs, timeline)


1. Confirm the tone reads as more premium — word choice, pacing, and framing should feel distinct from the original mass-market version.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image34.png)


## Exercise 5: Adapt the Campaign for Regional Stores

Zava Retail's regional store directors have flagged that a single national message doesn't land the same way in every market. In this exercise, you will generate four regional versions of the same campaign.

### Task 1 – Generate Regional Variants

1. In the same conversation, enter the following prompt, then select Send:

    ```
    Create four regional versions of this campaign for: North stores, South
    stores, Urban stores, and Rural stores. Highlight any differences in
    messaging, product mix emphasis, or channel priority for each version,
    while keeping the core campaign objective identical.
    ```

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image35.png)

1. Review each of the four versions and confirm:

    - Each has a distinct regional angle (e.g., Urban emphasizes foot
    traffic and digital signage; Rural emphasizes SMS and local relevance)

    - All four versions stay consistent with the original campaign objective
    and KPIs

    - There are no contradictory claims between versions

## Exercise 7: Prepare the Executive Approval Package

David Kim has one rule for Friday's leadership review: every campaign pitch must be scannable in under two minutes. In this exercise, you will generate a complete executive approval package from the campaign you've built.

### Task 1 – Generate the Executive Approval Package

1. In the same conversation, enter the following prompt, then select Send:

    ```
    Prepare an executive approval package for this campaign, including:
    - Executive summary
    - Expected business impact
    - Campaign risks
    - Assumptions
    - Success metrics
    - Approval checklist
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/MsIQ-cplt-agntsfrntr/refs/heads/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205/media/image40.png)

1. Review the response, it must cover the following points:

    - Executive Summary: 3–5 sentence overview for a VP-level decision-maker
    - Expected Business Impact: quantified or directional impact (revenue,
    traffic, engagement)

    - Campaign Risks: realistic risks (e.g., inventory shortfall, message
    fatigue, timing conflicts)

    - Assumptions: explicitly flagged placeholders (budget, dates, inventory
    levels)

    - Success Metrics: tied back to the KPIs from Exercise 3
    - Approval Checklist: actionable items (e.g., Legal review, Brand
    review, Budget sign-off, Channel scheduling confirmed)

## Summary

In this lab, you used Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to build a custom marketing operations agent for Zava Retail — configuring enterprise instructions that enforce a consistent campaign structure, generating a full campaign brief and multi-channel creative assets, refining the campaign for a premium loyalty audience, adapting it across four store regions, and packaging it for executive approval, before publishing it for the wider marketing team.

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
- Create a custom Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat agent and configure
  enterprise-grade instructions

- Generate a structured campaign brief and creative assets, including
  generated images

- Refine and adapt a campaign for different audiences, channels, and
  regions while preserving the original objective and KPIs

- Prepare a leadership-ready executive approval package
